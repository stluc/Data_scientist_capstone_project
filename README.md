## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

- SciKit-Learn
- PyTorch
- imblearn
- Matplotlib
- numpy
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.* (Python 3.8 was used).

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The data provided was heavily imbalanced and a lot of data from the features was missing. The project assigned as capstone project by Udacity was a good exercise to handle data which must be interpreted and sorted out as well as understanding the issues regarding machine learning models during data science process.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The full analysis is contained in the jupyter notebook. Most of the functions are written in a separate file that needs to be imported named 'AidFunctions.py'.
Due to privacy agreement the dataset used is not made available as well as all the models and data interpretation sheets.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@iamjuststen/-).
